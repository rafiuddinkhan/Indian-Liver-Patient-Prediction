# Indian Liver Patient Prediction
## A Machine Learning Approach for the prediction and classification of Indian Liver Patient data.

Problems with liver patients are not easily discovered in an early stage as it will be functioning normally even when it is partially damaged. 
An early diagnosis of liver problems will increase patient’s survival rate.Liver failures are at high rate of risk among Indians. It is expected that by 2025 India may become the World Capital for Liver Diseases. The widespread occurrence of liver infection in India is contributed due to deskbound lifestyle, increased alcohol consumption and smoking.There are about 100 types of liver infections.
Therefore,developing a machine that will enhance in the diagnosis of the disease will be of a great advantage in the medical field. These systems will help the physicians in making accurate decisions on patients and also with the help of Automatic classification tools for liver diseases (probably mobile enabled or web enabled), one can reduce the patient queue at the liver experts such as endocrinologists.

This project compares three of the most popular ML techniques commonly used for breast cancer detection and
diagnosis, namely:
* Naive Bayes 
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest (RF) 
* Logistic Regression 
* Nearest Neighbor
* Decision Tree
